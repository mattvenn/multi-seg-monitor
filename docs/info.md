## How it works

Instead of building a wall out of hundreds of 7 segment displays, this simulates one
on a VGA screen: a **64 x 37 grid of digits — 2368 digits, 18944 segments** — each
segment with its own 4 bit brightness, sent through a colour palette on the way out.

There is no framebuffer. The chip races the beam and keeps only the digit row it is
currently drawing, in a 1 kB line buffer holding four rows of 256 bytes. Each segment
is rendered as the AND of an x zone and a y zone within its 12x16 cell, so a digit
costs a handful of constant comparisons rather than a bitmap lookup.

Data comes from one of two places, selected by `uio[7]`:

- **Internal generator** (`uio[7]` low) — draws a zone plate across the whole grid,
  so the design produces a moving picture with no external data at all.
- **Stream port** (`uio[7]` high) — a byte on `ui_in` latched on the rising edge of
  the strobe on `uio[6]`. Byte *n* of a frame is digit *n*/4, nibble pair *n*%4;
  256 bytes per row, 9472 per frame. The write pointer resets on vsync, so the link
  is self synchronising: a lost or extra byte costs one frame and then corrects.

### The generator

Two points wander the screen on triangle wave Lissajous paths, and each segment's
brightness is the sum of its squared distances to them, folded into a triangle wave
and offset by a phase that runs with time: rings that tighten outward and flow. It
is a pure function of position and time, so it needs no framebuffer either — the
chip computes one segment per cycle and shares a single squarer between the four
squares a sample needs.

It also varies itself, slowly. Neither the ring phase nor the source points' time
is a product of the frame number: each is an accumulator, and what varies is the
amount added per frame. A speed can therefore change without the picture ever
jumping — the ring speed wanders between slightly reversed, through stopped, to 3x
over a 2.3 minute round trip, and the drift speed between 0.5x and 1.4x over 4.5
minutes. The palette changes itself every 512 frames
(~8.5 s), fading through black across the change so it is a dip rather than a cut.

`ui_in[6:1]` are read as live DIP switches while the generator is drawing, since
nothing else is using those pins then. All off is the behaviour above:

| Bit | Off | On |
|---|---|---|
| `ui_in[3:1]` | starting palette (also the reset strap) | the palette held in manual mode |
| `ui_in[4]` | change palette every 512 frames | hold the palette `ui_in[3:1]` names |
| `ui_in[5]` | ring speed wanders | steady ring speed |
| `ui_in[6]` | drift speed wanders | steady drift |

A switch setting is only applied once two consecutive frames have sampled the same
value, so a config byte on the bus across a frame boundary cannot be read as a
switch position; and the first valid config packet header stops the switches being
read at all, because a host drives these pins to send one.

### Colour

Brightness goes out through a palette: three per channel curves, each two straight
lines through a movable knee, clipped at 15. `ui_in[3:0]` is sampled while `rst_n`
is low as a config strap — `ui_in[0]` picks the Pmod, `ui_in[3:1]` one of 8 built
in palettes — and a config packet strobed in on `uio[6]` while `uio[7]` is low can
override the Pmod and load any curve at all.

Pacing falls out of the geometry. A digit row is 16 scanlines and 256 bytes, and
16 x 1056 / 256 = **66 pixel clocks per byte, exactly** — no remainder to accumulate,
so a host running at a fixed byte rate tracks the raster indefinitely. Four row
buffers rather than two let that host run 1-3 rows ahead without any per-row
handshake.

Video timing is 800x600 @ 60 Hz from a 40 MHz pixel clock.

On the ASIC the line buffer is the IHP foundry macro
`RM_IHPSG13_1P_1024x8_c2_bm_bist`, single port, byte wide, one cycle read latency.
The renderer reads 2 of every 12 cycles and the source writes into the gaps, so read
and write are never asserted together — which is what allows a single port macro.

## How to test

**With no external data.** Leave `uio[7]` low, apply a 40 MHz clock and release
reset. You should get a zone plate drawn across the 64x37 grid: concentric rings
that tighten outward and flow slowly, with the palette changing every ~8.5 s through
a fade to black. That exercises all 16 brightness levels, all 7 lit segments, the
whole grid and the palette without anything driving the input pins. Then flip
`ui_in[6:1]` — each switch in the table above should change what you see within
two frames.

**Streaming.** Set `uio[7]` high and push 9472 bytes per frame on `ui_in`, one byte
every 66 pixel clocks, restarting on each vsync. `tools/video2seg.py` in the project
repository converts any video or still image into that format, and
`firmware/seg_player.py` streams it from the demoboard's RP2350 over PIO and DMA.

## External hardware

**Digilent PmodVGA**, plugged across both output headers — R and B nibbles on
`uo_out`, the G nibble plus hsync and vsync on `uio[5:0]`. The 6 bit intensity is
carries 4 bits per channel, so the palette's colours come out as sent. The classic
Tiny Tapeout VGA Pmod works too — strap `ui_in[0]` high at reset and the video
moves entirely onto `uo_out` at 2 bits per channel, with `uio` left all input.

The stream port's strobe and mode select sit on `uio[7:6]`, which PmodVGA leaves
not connected — that is what freed them.

Streaming needs a host on `ui_in[7:0]`. On the Tiny Tapeout demoboard those are
GPIO17-24 on the RP2350, contiguous, so a whole byte leaves in a single PIO
instruction.
